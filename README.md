Hello! And nice to meet you ;)
 
My name is Mokhamed. I am an experienced developer, validator, node-runner on a lot of blockchains. In the crypto space I have been for 2+ years, and already know a lot. I learn more every single day. I am an individual validator, working on creating a non-custodial staking service “istake” (in development)
I have the ready infrastructure for rapid deploy a new testnet or mainnet nodes in most popular ecosystems (Polkadot substrate and Cosmos tendermint).
My moniker for all my nodes: isavazh | istake#5039
Languages that I speak: Russian and Ukrainian (fluent) Arabic, France, German, English
 
Joined lot of Cosmos projects as a testnet/mainnet validator have experience in using gorc / peggo etc. I am professionally engaged in the installation and maintenance of validator nodes for a long time and have a lot of experience in this area. By accepting me as a validator in your network, you can be sure that my validator will be updated in a timely manner, fully protected, with high uptime, and hot-reserved with the second node in case of problems with the main node.
